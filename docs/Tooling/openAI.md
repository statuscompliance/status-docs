# OpenAI

Users with access credentials to the node-RED editor will be able to make use of a chatbot implemented through the [OpenAi assistant](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview).

Figure 1 shows one of the main use cases of the chatbot, that of making mashup descriptions. In addition to this, it describes what each node does separately.

On the other hand, an administration view of the openAI service has also been created in order to be able to manage the instructions of the assistants, activate/deactivate this service, limit the number of assistants, create and delete them (see Figure 2).
