# Bluejay Infrastructure

Bluejay Infrastructure is a Governify-based infrastructure that allows to audit agile teams in a simple way. It is composed of a subset of Governify microservices that can be deployed either in a single machine or in a cluster. Bluejay access multiple sources to gather information about development teams, such as GitLab, Jira, Slack, etc. and uses this information to check if those teams are being compliant with a Team Practices Agreement (TPA) which includes metrics and guarantees related to the agile methodology.
